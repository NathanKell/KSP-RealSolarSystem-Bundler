Real Solar System
=================

"Real Solar System" (RSS) is a mod for Kerbal Space Program (KSP) that makes the default solar system mimic the "real" Solar System. This bundler automatically obtains, checks, and installs several other mods that when used with RSS further increase realism.

This program contains defaults for setting up RSS.


Requirements
------------

Java: most systems have it by default.


Use
-----

1) Run the "real-solar-system" script, which on Windows is "real-solar-system.bat" and on Linux or Mac is "real-solar-system.sh" instead.

2) Each time the bundler runs, it downloads a manifest for this "Real Solar System" bundle. Choose your desired mods and click the "build it" button to download, unpack, and install them into a zipped `build` directory where you put the bundler's script. 

3) Unzip the zip file to your KSP installation directory.


Notes
------
*You can download the manifest file, tweak it, and open it manually via the "File" menu.
*The default build file will be about 180MB; customizations may lessen or greaten it.
*The bundler's defaults are easily tweaked.
