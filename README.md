Real Solar System Bundler
===========================

"Real Solar System" (RSS) is a mod for Kerbal Space Program (KSP) that changes the default solar system to mimic the "real" Solar System. It is recommended to use it with a whole host of other mods, which increase the realism of the game further, but as a result it becomes increasingly complicated to set up. In fact, because there are so many different ways to configure the various mods, it is quite difficult even to instruct others how to set it up!

This script is an attempt to "canonicalize" a set of defaults for setting up RSS. These defaults are based on my own preferences, but they form a decent starting point for others who are curious about the mod, and the defaults are easily tweaked if you prefer different settings.

Because this was written for my own use, it is in very rough form. If that bothers you, pull-requests are welcome. :)
